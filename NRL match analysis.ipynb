    "The Dally M Team of the Year is the National Rugby League of Australia's equivalent to an all-Pro team in American sports.  Each week, journalists and commentators across Australia pick their team of the week and at the end of the season, the votes are combined to select a Team of the Year.  Since most of the people voting on team of the week are doing so subjectively, there is often a bit controversy when the Dally M Team of the Year is revealed at the end of the season.  Last year is a prime example:\n",

    "\n",
    "While 6 of the 9 selections in 2018's Team of the Year were well received, there was plenty of outrage on social media over the selections of Joseph Leilua (centre), Luke Brooks (halfback) and Josh Jackson (second-row).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis I will look into data from the 2018 NRL season to determine whether or not the Dally M Team of the Year was an accurate reflection of player performance.  The data I'm using was scraped from the official NRL website (www.nrl.com) using Selenium and Python's BeautifulSoup library and compiled into a database.  The database contains detailed player stats from every match.  In order to determine whether or not a player deserved to be in Team of the Year, I will first analyze various stats to determine which were the most highly correlated with a team's number of wins over the course of the season.  Once I've determined which stats are most important in contributing to a victory, I will compare players at each position by these stats to determine who deserved to be in 2018's Team of the Year."

There are some fairly obvious stats with strong correlations like points_scored, total_run_metres and tries (the rugby equivalent of a touchdown in football). There are also some stats with correlations that are a bit surprising.  I would have predicted to see a strong negative correlation between wins and errors, however, the correlation is slightly positive although very weak.  This could be explained by the fact that many errors fall under the category of \"handling errors\" which means that a team with posession dropped the ball, thereby surrending it to the other team.  Teams with more position are more likely to commit handling errors and similarly, teams with more posession are likely to score more points which correlates highly with winning."

When conducting deeper analysis on the controversial selections, I will also take into conserdation the stats that are more applicable to the individual positions.  Player positions in rugby can be fall under the categories of forwards or backs. Forwards tend to be larger, slower players who have more of a defenisve impact while spending most of their time towards the middle of the field.  Backs tend to play out wide because they're smaller and quicker which makes them more of an attacking threat in space.  Backs also tend to do the vast majority of a team's kicking. \n",
