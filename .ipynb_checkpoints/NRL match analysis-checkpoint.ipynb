    "The Dally M Team of the Year is the National Rugby League of Australia's equivalent to an all-Pro team in American sports.  Each week, journalists and commentators across Australia pick their team of the week and at the end of the season, the votes are combined to select a Team of the Year.  Since most of the people voting on team of the week are doing so subjectively, there is often a bit controversy when the Dally M Team of the Year is revealed at the end of the season.  Last year is a prime example:\n",

    "\n",
    "While 6 of the 9 selections in 2018's Team of the Year were well received, there was plenty of outrage on social media over the selections of Joseph Leilua (centre), Luke Brooks (halfback) and Josh Jackson (second-row).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis I will look into data from the 2018 NRL season to determine whether or not the Dally M Team of the Year was an accurate reflection of player performance.  The data I'm using was scraped from the official NRL website (www.nrl.com) using Selenium and Python's BeautifulSoup library and compiled into a database.  The database contains detailed player stats from every match.  In order to determine whether or not a player deserved to be in Team of the Year, I will first analyze various stats to determine which were the most highly correlated with a team's number of wins over the course of the season.  Once I've determined which stats are most important in contributing to a victory, I will compare players at each position by these stats to determine who deserved to be in 2018's Team of the Year."
