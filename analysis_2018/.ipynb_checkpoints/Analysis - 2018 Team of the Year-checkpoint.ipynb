    "The Dally M Team of the Year is the National Rugby League of Australia's equivalent to an all-Pro team in American sports.  Each week, journalists and commentators across Australia pick their team of the week and at the end of the season, the votes are combined to select a Team of the Year.  Since most of the people voting on team of the week are doing so subjectively, there is often a bit controversy when the Dally M Team of the Year is revealed at the end of the season.  Last year is a prime example:\n",

    "\n",
    "While most of the 9 selections in 2018's Team of the Year were well received, there was plenty of outrage on social media over a few, most notably the selections of Joseph Leilua (centre) and Josh Jackson (second-row).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis I will look into data from the 2018 NRL season to determine whether or not the Dally M Team of the Year was an accurate reflection of player performance.  The data I'm using was scraped from the official NRL website (www.nrl.com) using Selenium and Python's BeautifulSoup library and compiled into a database.  The database contains detailed player stats from every match.  In order to determine whether or not a player deserved to be in Team of the Year, I will first analyze various stats to determine which were the most highly correlated with a team's number of wins over the course of the season.  Once I've determined which stats are most important in contributing to a victory, I will compare players at each position by these stats to determine who deserved to be in 2018's Team of the Year."

There are some fairly obvious stats with strong correlations like points_scored, total_run_metres and tries (the rugby equivalent of a touchdown in football). There are also some stats with correlations that are a bit surprising.  I would have predicted to see a strong negative correlation between wins and errors, however, the correlation is slightly positive although very weak.  This could be explained by the fact that many errors fall under the category of \"handling errors\" which means that a team with posession dropped the ball, thereby surrending it to the other team.  Teams with more position are more likely to commit handling errors and similarly, teams with more posession are likely to score more points which correlates highly with winning."

When conducting deeper analysis on the controversial selections, I will also take into conserdation the stats that are more applicable to the individual positions.  Player positions in rugby can be fall under the categories of forwards or backs. Forwards tend to be larger, slower players who have more of a defenisve impact while spending most of their time towards the middle of the field.  Backs tend to play out wide because they're smaller and quicker which makes them more of an attacking threat in space.  Backs also tend to do the vast majority of a team's kicking. \n",

    "In the above analysis, I chose to sort players first by total_run_metres and then by tries.  Even though tries have a stronger correlation with wins than total running metres, many tries involve the contributions of many different players similar to touchdowns in football.  In order to determine which individual players excelled in comparison to others, I felt that running meters would be a good starting point since this is one of the strongest indicators of a player's overall performance regardless of their position or stle of play."

    "One of the most controversial selections in the 2018 Team of the Year was Joseph Leilua of the Canberra Raiders at Centre.  Many felt that Latrell Mitchell of the Sydney Roosters should have been selected.  Players who are Centres play out wide and tend to be a team's most powerful ball-runners. For this reason, running stats and tries are the best measures of a players performance. Centres aren't as involved defensively as other positions, however, missed tackles at this position can be costly and more likely to lead to a try to the opposition. For this reason, we don't necessarily care if a centre has a high tackle count, however, we'd like them to have a high tackle percentage."

    "Despite the harsh criticism from social media, we can see that Joseph Leilua's Team of the Year selection is justified given the voting process.  Despite not even finishing in the top 7 players for rushing metres, Latrell Mitchell finished tied for second place, most likley due to his huge impacting in scoring and setting up tries.  Although one can easily end up with different results by playing around with the formula for players of the week, we can conclude that the current formula is pretty accurate in giving weight to the statistics that matter to rugby fans and journalists."

    "Another controversial selection in the 2018 Team of the Year was Josh Jackson at Second Row.  In order to judge whether or not this was a fair selection based off the Team of the Year selection process,  I will update the scoring formula that calculates top performers by week so it more accurately grades players who are in the Second Row.  Second Rowers are forwards who are larger and play towards the center of the field. While we would like to see these players get a lot of running metres and score tries, we primarily want these players to have lots of tackles. Their main priority is to make as many tackles as possible, trying to stop the opposition as quickly as possible before they have the chance to get the ball out wide to their major try-scoring threats."

    "This bar graph shows us that James Tedesco made a larger contribution to his team's statistical output over the course of 2018 than Roger Tuivasa-Sheck.  Combining this data with Tedesco's superior fullback of the week vote count, its very surprising that Tuivasa-Sheck was named to the Team of the Year over Tedesco."

    "From this analysis, we can see that the collective opinion of fans should not take the place of statistical analysis when evaluating athletic performance.  We demonstrated that two of the more controversial selections for the NRL's 2018 Team of the Year were completely justified given the selection criteria and demands of the individual positions, while one of the most widely agreed upon selections appears to have been misguided.  For a follow up to this analysis, I would like to see if I can accurately predict the 2019 Team of the Year using the methodology that I used to determine top performers of each week from 2018. "
